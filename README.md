# Aspect-based sentiment analysis vietnamese
### Introduction
The demand for online shopping is steadily increasing, leading to a growing pool of customer feedback and opinions on products and services.
Exploiting this data aims to enhance product and service quality, boosting the supplier's reputation and ultimately achieving optimal profitability.
This research delves into the problem of sentiment analysis based on aspects within customer feedback and opinions collected from e-commerce platforms.
This research proposes several methods for extracting aspects present in customer reviews.
Furthermore, based on the extracted aspects, the next step involves sentiment classification on these aspects.
In other words, instead of creating two separate models for two distinct tasks, the goal is to develop a multi-task model.
This approach aims to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of customer sentiment by considering both the overall sentiment and the sentiment towards specific aspects of the product or service.
This research aims to develop a multi-task model that can simultaneously extract aspects and classify sentiment on those aspects, thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of customer feedback.
This approach offers a more efficient and effective way to analyze customer feedback, as it avoids the need to train separate models for each task.
